# FIR-LSTM
FIR-LSTM is an interpretable deep learning framework for clinical time-series prediction.
It uses a uni-directional LSTM model explained by Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to identify how each feature and time epoch contributes to the final risk prediction.

## Model Overview

Architecture: multi-layer unidirectional LSTM

Explainability: LRP backpropagates relevance to quantify feature importance

Inputs: 6 time epochs Ã— 66 features (per patient sequence)

Outputs: Binary classification + calibrated risk score
