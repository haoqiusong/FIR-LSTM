# FIR-LSTM

FIR-LSTM is an interpretable deep learning framework for clinical time-series prediction.
It uses a uni-directional LSTM model explained by Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to identify how each feature and time epoch contributes to the final risk prediction.

## Model Overview

**Architecture**: multi-layer unidirectional LSTM

**Explainability**: LRP backpropagates relevance to quantify feature importance

**Inputs**: 6 time epochs Ã— 66 features (per patient sequence)

**Outputs**: Binary classification performance (ROC, PRC, calibration curve, training loss, feature importance visualizations) + calibrated risk score (for individual datapoints)

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/haoqiusong/FIR-LSTM.git
cd FIR-LSTM
```

### Create a Python environment (optional)

```
conda create -n firlstm python=3.11
conda activate firlstm
```

#### Notes

1. Tested on Python 3.11.5 and PyTorch 2.5.1 (CUDA 11.8).
2. GPU acceleration is automatically used if CUDA is available.
3. You can modify hyperparameters and file paths directly in the Python scripts.
4. The demo, which operates on simulated data rather than real patient records, executes in roughly one minute on a standard desktop workstation.
