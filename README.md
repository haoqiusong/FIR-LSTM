# FIR-LSTM > A reproducible and interpretable deep learning framework for clinical time-series modeling.

FIR-LSTM is an interpretable deep learning framework for clinical time-series prediction.
It uses a uni-directional LSTM model explained by Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to identify how each feature and time epoch contributes to the final risk prediction.

## Model Overview

**Architecture**: multi-layer unidirectional LSTM

**Explainability**: LRP backpropagates relevance to quantify feature importance

**Inputs**: 6 time epochs Ã— 66 features (per patient sequence)

**Outputs**: Binary classification + calibrated risk score
