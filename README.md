# FIR-LSTM
This is the architecture of FIR-LSTM, a uni-directional LSTM model explained by Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP).

In our experiments, the input is the time-series data, each datapoint contains 6 time epochs, and each time epoch contains 66 features. The final outputs include binary classification and calibrated risk score.
